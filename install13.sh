#Test #1: Fortran + C + NetCDF
#The NetCDF-only test requires the include file from the NETCDF package be in this directory. Copy the file here:
cp ${NETCDF}/include/netcdf.inc .
#Compile the Fortran and C codes for the purpose of this test (the -c option says to not try to build an executable). Type the following commands:
gfortran -c 01_fortran+c+netcdf_f.f
gcc -c 01_fortran+c+netcdf_c.c
gfortran 01_fortran+c+netcdf_f.o 01_fortran+c+netcdf_c.o -L${NETCDF}/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf
./a.out
#The following should be displayed on your screen:
#C function called by Fortran
#Values are xx = 2.00 and ii = 1
#SUCCESS test 1 fortran + c + netcdf
#Test #2: Fortran + C + NetCDF + MPI
cp ${NETCDF}/include/netcdf.inc .
